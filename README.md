# How to use Vimera?

After downloading the Vimera application, you will find two options: **Vimera_x64.exe** and **Vimera_arm64.exe**. Which file to choose depends on your computerâ€™s processor architecture. Hereâ€™s a guide to help you decide which version is right for you:

#### 1. Vimera_x64.exe
- **Vimera_x64.exe** is designed for computers with an x64 (64-bit) processor architecture.
- If youâ€™re using a standard Windows PC or laptop, you likely need the x64 version.
- Most devices with Intel or AMD processors use the x64 architecture.

#### 2. Vimera_arm64.exe
- **Vimera_arm64.exe** is specifically developed for devices with an ARM64 architecture.
- Itâ€™s suitable for Windows devices that use **ARM processors** (such as some Surface models).
- ARM architecture is commonly found in devices that prioritize lower power consumption and portability.

#### Usage Instructions
1. **After downloading the ZIP file, make sure to extract all files from the ZIP**. The Vimera application is a portable software, so it doesnâ€™t require installation, but all files must be in the same folder for it to run correctly.
2. Once extracted, run the appropriate file for your device (**Vimera_x64.exe** or **Vimera_arm64.exe**) to start using the application immediately.
